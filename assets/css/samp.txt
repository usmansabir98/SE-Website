The library offers specialized services in the Campus utilizing computerized retrieval of bibliographic databases containing references to thousands of articles, books, proceedings, technical reports and statistics.

Research Areas

Computer Vision & Image Processing

Research in this area includes modelling   object   behaviour, human facial and body action, facial synthesis and super resolution, multi-modal biometrics, 3D deformable shape, and structure from motion. The work has been widely applied to vehicle and people detection and tracking; behaviour screening and anomaly detection in public space CCTV
 
Software Engineering	


The research is directed towards techniques, methods and processes for development of large complex software intensive systems. Current areas of research include Requirements Engineering, Verification & Validation, Software Process Quality, System Safety, and Software Management. The research results may be applied to a variety of application areas ranging from small- embedded systems to large software applications.

 

Natural Language Processing

This research area focuses on algorithms that allow computers to process and analyze human languages. This research area ranges from basic research in computational linguistics to key applications in human language technology, which covers areas such as semantics, tagging, information extraction and named entity recognition. This will involve data analysis with innovative rule-based, probabilistic and machine learning approaches to NLP.
 
Machine Learning	


Machine learning is the study of adaptive computational systems that improve their performance with experience. Research in this area focuses primarily on natural language learning, statistical relational learning, transfer learning, and active learning, particularly with application in speech and computer vision domains.

 

Data Mining

Data mining research focuses on the development of new algorithms, many of which are based on optimization approaches, but also on the development of new tools and applications. The research includes work  on  semi-structured  data  and text, as well as stream data. Data mining application in Education and Health domain is under research.
 
Network & Information Security	


Research in this area includes computer security, cryptography and network security. Some of the key research themes are Anonymity, Authenticity, Availability, Digital Rights Management, Identity Management, Information Hiding, Privacy, Cryptanalysis, Computer Security: defenses against malware Reliability, Human Aspects of Security, Watermarking, Steganography and Steganalysis. It also includes quantum cryptography (or Quantum Key Distribution), which is a new trend in information security

 

Speech Processing and Recognition

Research in this area is being conducted on developing methods for robust speech recognition, speaker verification and applications of speech processing using machine learning techniques
